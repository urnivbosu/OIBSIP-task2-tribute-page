            <h2>MS Dhoni</h2>
            <p>
                When we talk about the best Indian cricket players, MS Dhoni is among the top names on the list. MS Dhoniâ€™s full name is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He was the former captain of the Indian team for one-day, T20, and test cricket. He also led the team to their first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India became the first team to whitewash Australia in a Test series, after a time period of two decades. Dhoni also led the Indian team to the number one position in the ICC rankings in Test cricket.</p>
