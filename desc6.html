            <h2>Shoaib Akhtar</h2>
            <p>Shoaib Akhtar is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in all three formats of the game for fourteen years. Born on the 13th of August, 1975; he earned the nickname “Rawalpindi Express” since he hails from Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan.

                He was a right handed fast bowler and is known to have delivered the fastest delivery in the history of cricket.
                
                The delivery was as fast as 161.3 km/h and was bowled against England in the group stages of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003.Akhtar's debut was to have come against India in the 1996 Sahara Cup played in Toronto. However, he was sent home due to indiscipline and poor attitude.

                He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. His debut was quiet and modest as he managed to pick only 2 wickets.
                
                He first proved himself during Pakistan's tour to South Africa in 1998. Having come into the match with a knee injury, he bowled at pace to take 5/43 and help Pakistan win in South Africa for the first time.</p>
