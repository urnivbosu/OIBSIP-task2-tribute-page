            <h2>AB de  Villiers</h2>
            <p>A 360-degree batter who could hit any ball anywhere, against any bowler, AB de Villiers was a bona fide South African great: a cricketer with overflowing talent and the temperament to back it up, a fielder able to leap tall buildings and still come up with the catch - and who could happily assume the wicketkeeper's spot if needed. As if all that wasn't enough, he was also a fine rugby player, golfer, and tennis player.

                De Villiers broke the world record for the fastest ODI hundred in 2015, getting to the milestone off 31 balls in a breathtaking innings that included the fastest ODI fifty as well as 16 sixes, also the world record at that time. He was South Africa's leading run-scorer (and captain) in the World Cup that followed but couldn't take them past the semi-final stage.
                
                De Villiers made his Test debut as an opener against England in 2004 (in the same match as Dale Steyn), when he was picked after only 16 first-class matches. He was later moved into the middle order and asked to keep wicket, which he did successfully: he batted everywhere from No. 1 to No. 8 and performed well in most of those positions.</p>
